# Psychrometric-tools

This repository contains programs for calculating Psychrometric Properties for an "Atmospheric Water Generator" (AWG) device, which extracts water from humid ambient air by cooling it below its dew point. In order to optimize the performance of the AWG, the precise calculation and analysis of psychrometric properties are essential.
